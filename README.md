# Hexmap
Hexmap is a modular system for creating physical worlds for games like Dnd or for just building worlds.

# Format
A hexmap is made up of multiple hexs that are built up in four main layers. The first is the baseplate which is a large plate with a hexagonal grid that the next layer fits into. The second layer is purely structural and is used to provide a raised bed for the third layer to sit on. The third layer is the layer that contains the actual terrain along with wome of the features on the terrain. The forth and final layer is for features not contained in the third layer. The forth layer fits into certain tiles from the third layer. It is mostly used for large features that would not fit onto a single tile.
